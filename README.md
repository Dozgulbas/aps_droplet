# aps_droplet
This repository consist a documentation for the "Droplet" experiment that is going to be perfomed at APS, Argonne National Laboratory.

## RoboDK

For this experiment, RoboDK software has been utilized and 3D CAD drawings have experted into the simulation environment which mimics the actual experimental environment located at APS/8_ID_I. An UR3e robot has been programed to perform the "Droplet" experiment and a python program is implemented to establish palletizing movements on the 96 pippette tips.
